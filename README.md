![](https://badgen.net/badge/iOS/Objective-C/orange)

* **Platform:** iOS (Objective-C)
* **Aplication Language:** English

## Description
A simple Objective C app that consumes data from The Movie DB API made in order to study and learn the language. The app makes use of tableViews and CollectionViews, asynchronous API calls among other things.

### XCTest
We did a swizzling on our network layer tests to the URL request. It now uses the mocked data instead of the API data
